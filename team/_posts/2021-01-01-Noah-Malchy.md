From Mission, British Columbia, Noah graduated in 2019 from University with a BSc in Biology.  He pivoted careers into programming and briefly worked as a Full-Stack Software Developer in Maple Ridge before joining the Aparicio Lab 2020.  He is currently our front-end developer for all our internal applications.

In his spare time he enjoys rockin' out on the drums, playing competitive sports/videogames, and he always has an audiobook on the go!
