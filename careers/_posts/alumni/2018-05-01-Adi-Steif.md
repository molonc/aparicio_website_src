Adi Steif joined the Aparicio Lab in 2012, and under the co-supervision of Drs. Sam Aparicio and Sohrab Shah graduated in 2018 for her work [Tumour evolution at single-cell resolution](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0365645). She was also the recipient of the [2015 Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/about-us/news/congratulations-ubcs-newest-vanier-scholarship-recipients) and the [Schmidt Science Fellowship in 2018](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/about-us/news/ubc-doctoral-student-receives-prestigious-schmidt-science-fellowship).  Since graduating Adi has worked with Prof John Marioni in Cambridge, UK and used her placement as a Schmidt Science Fellow to develop her skills in probabilistic modeling and machine learning.  Adi brought together her experience in cancer research and advances in computational approaches together to generate new insights into single-cell biology during normal development and early carcinogenesis. After completing her fellowship, Adi continues her work as a Junior Research Fellow at Trinity College, University of Cambridge.
