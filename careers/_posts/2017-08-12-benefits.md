## Benefits

As researchers, we are fortunate to have the generous support of donors and grants that enable our pursuit of cutting-edge science.  Our close collaboration with physicians and doctors at BC Cancer, across Canada and internationally allow us unparalleled access to patients and cases that we owe our success to.  Finally, we share close collaborations with UBC professors that empower a majority of our interdisciplinary work.

As staff, we enjoy a healthy work-life balance and meaningful contributions to science.  We aim to have an atmosphere of fun and learning, working in a small but amazing of individuals helping make a difference in the world.  Employed under both PHSA and UBC, we enjoy generous benefits include vacation, insurance and pension.
